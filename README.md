TrackFacts 2023 - V1

This is the first version of the TrackFacts App for my portfolio

Main aim is to build MVP for allowing Users to CRUD an account & Admin User to CRUD a Track and finally allow Users to View Track Index and Show Pages.

Second stage will be to add an Event Model which will provide user with a calender for Track Events and allow them to "Follow" Tracks.

Stack is;
Rails 7
Ruby 3
PostGres
Devise for Auth
RSpec for testing (inc Shoulda Matches and FactoryBot)
