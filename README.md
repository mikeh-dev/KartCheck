KartCheck 2023 - V1

This is my second self-guided app and first using Tailwind CSS, I did use a Tailwind Starter template called KickOff Tailwind to provide the basics.

This is the first version of the KartCheck app, the plan is for this to be a digital logbook for users to register their chassis' and engines

It will allow other users to search for those to check their history, check the stolen status, and transfer ownership.

Stack is;
Rails 7
Ruby 3
PostGres
Devise for Auth
RSpec for testing (inc Shoulda Matches and FactoryBot)
